# PocketBase URL

In order to make the frontend and tagger aware of the PocketBase service, the `POCKETBASE_URL` environment variable should be set.

For the Next.js server, if for example Share Me is deployed with Docker and not available through a domain, you can also set the `POCKETBASE_SERVER_URL` environment variable.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;
