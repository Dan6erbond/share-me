# File Size Limit

Since files are uploaded through PocketBase, their limits can be configured in the PocketBase admin UI. Head to Collections > `files` > Settings <TbSettings /> and edit the file column settings. Set the Max file size to whatever you want.

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

  />
  <span>PocketBase Maximum File Size Limit</span>
