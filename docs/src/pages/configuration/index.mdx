Once the server and frontend have been deployed, PocketBase needs to be setup initially with an admin account. Head to [https://shareme.example.com/_/](https://shareme.example.com/_/) to begin the configuration.

!> PocketBase admin accounts aren't the same as Share Me user accounts. You still need to create a user in the `users` collection or sign-up via the frontend.

After the configuration you can also change other settings in PocketBase. See the sidebar for more information.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;
