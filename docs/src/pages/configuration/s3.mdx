# S3

PocketBase supports S3 as a file backend. This includes S3-compatible services such as MinIO or DigitalOcean Spaces.

?> Any files uploaded before configuring S3 must be moved manually to the S3 bucket.

To configure S3, head to the PocketBase admin UI, Settings > Files storage and setup the S3 connection details.

PocketBase will automatically upload any new files to the configured S3 bucket.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;
