# Tagger

A separate tagger service can be deployed as part of the Share Me stack to run object detection on all uploaded files.

It can be added to the Compose stack like so:

```yml
services:
  ...
  tagger:
    image: ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-tagger:latest
    environment:
      POCKETBASE_URL: https://shareme.example.com
      POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL: <admin-email>
      POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: <admin-password>
    ports:
      - 5000:80
```

Once the tagger has been deployed, it can be configured on the server by setting the `TAGGER_HOST` environment variable:

```
TAGGER_HOST=http://tagger:80
```

## Running Tagging Manually

The tagger exposes one API route, which detects objects and adds them to the `tagsSuggestions` attribute of a file item:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:5000/files/<fild-id>' \
  --header 'Accept: */*'
```

The endpoint will return a `HTTP 202 Accepted` response and run the tagging async. The UI will reflect the suggestions if any are available.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>;
