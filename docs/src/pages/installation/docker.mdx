# Docker

Share Me requires two Docker images to get started, the API which is based on PocketBase as well as the frontend which uses Next.js.

Both images are available on GHCR:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-frontend:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-server:latest
```

## Docker Compose

The recommended way to install Share Me is with Docker Compose.

You can use the following `docker-compose.yml` to deploy Share Me with persistence:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-server:latest
    volumes:
      - ./pb_data:/pb/pb_data
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-frontend:latest
    environment:
      POCKETBASE_URL: https://shareme.example.com
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

Then run the services with the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After installing, head to [Configuration](/configuration) to setup PocketBase and check out other configuration options.

Once Share Me is deployed and configured, users should look into setting up a reverse proxy. Visit [Proxy](/installation/proxy) for more information.

## Search

Share Me supports MeiliSearch for indexing and search. Follow the [MeiliSearch installation instructions](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/getting_started/installation) to run the MeiliSearch service:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 7700:7700 \
    -e MEILI_ENV='development' \
    -v $(pwd)/meili_data:/meili_data \
    getmeili/meilisearch:v1.1
```

After deploying MeiliSearch, the server needs to be configured to index posts and optionally old posts might need to be added to the index. See [Search Configuration](/configuration/search) for more details.

## Tagger

Share Me supports AI-based object recognition using Meta's ResNet 50 DETR model. The image for the tagger service is also available on GHCR and can be deployed as part of the Compose stack:

```yml
services:
  ...
  tagger:
    image: ghcr.io/dan6erbond/share-me-tagger:latest
    environment:
      POCKETBASE_URL: https://shareme.example.com
    ports:
      - 5000:80
```

The tagger needs to be configured in the server, in order to register the event hooks to generate tags when files are uploaded. For more information see [Tagger Configuration](/configuration/tagger).
