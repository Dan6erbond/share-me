# Installation

Share Me uses PocketBase and Next.js as its core stack. This means it can run as a standalone app, on Vercel, or using Docker.

## Quick Start

The recommended way to install Share Me is using Docker. See the [Docker](/installation/docker) guides.

After installing, head to [Configuration](/configuration) to setup PocketBase and check out other configuration options.

Once Share Me is deployed and configured, users should look into setting up a reverse proxy. Visit [Proxy](/installation/proxy) for more information.
