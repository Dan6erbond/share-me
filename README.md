## Usage

Share Me can be deployed to your own infrastructure with Docker. For more information see [Deployment](#deployment).

Once the initial setup is complete, head to the URL of your Share Me instance. You will be redirected to /login if you aren't logged in yet. Alternatively, you can create an account under /sign-up.

To create posts simply go back to the homepage after logging in, and

## Deployment

Use the sample `docker-compose.yml` to deploy your Share Me instance. This will deploy a PocketBase server at port `:8080` and the Next.js frontend to `:3000`.

### PocketBase URL

You can set the PocketBase server URL with `host:port` in the `POCKETBASE_URL` environment variable or a hostname if deployed with a reverse proxy.

### Reverse Proxy

If you have a reverse proxy such as Traefik or Apache, you can expose the application under `/` and the PocketBase API under `/api/` as well as the admin UI under `/_/`. This will be the optimal setup for production. The `POCKETBASE_URL` should be set to `https://shareme.example.com`.

## Configuration

### S3

S3 can be configured in PocketBase under Settings > Files storage. You can enable S3 and provide AWS S3 configurations or an S3-compatible API such as MinIO or DigitalOcean Spaces.

### SMTP

SMTP is used by Share Me for email verification (WIP). To configure a mail server head to Settings > Mail settings and configure your SMTP server.

### File Size Limit

The default file size limit is about 5MB and can be changed in the PocketBase UI. Head to Collections > files > Settings (cog icon) and edit the `file` column settings. Set the Max file size to whatever you want.

### Authentication

Share Me loads the configured PocketBase authentication providers. Head to your PocketBase admin dashboard, go to Settings > Auth providers and configure the ones you want to use.

To disable username/password and email/password login if you only want to allow access via SSO, go to Collections > users > Settings (cog icon) > Options and disable/enable the methods you want.
